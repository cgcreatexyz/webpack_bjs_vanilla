# Webpack BabylonJS starter 

BabylonJS scene with navbar. Uses @babylonjs/core etc modules.

([View demo on Netlify](cgcreatexyz-webpack-bjs-vanilla.netlify.app))

For now it has the basic sphere scene without any imported assets. WIP - working on asset folder copying to dist. Future merged branches will eventually include an hdr and imported glb. Vanilla JS, no CSS framework.
